# Alliance selection: a guide

Alliance selection is hard.
Teams suck at this.

And if you're bad at scouting you can't rely on first alliance 2nd picking you anymore, so you need to figure out how to actually play alliance selection now.

## Should I be worried about picking or elims?

Unless you plan on declining from playing in elims, the answer is **yes.**

Even down to:
* **6th and 7th seed** in 4-alliance brackets,
* **10th and 11th seed** in 6-alliance brackets,
* **14th and 15th seed** in 8-alliance brackets,

you may become a captain, and you should ideally be able to capitalize on that no matter the seed.
If you are nowhere near a captain slot, these lower-ranked seeds may also be the ones you need to shill to in order to play in elims.
Good strategy at low seeds can still produce deep elims runs; seeds 4-6 still make finals in competitive tournaments.

## What kind of robot do you want to be with in elims?

The overarching goal of an elims alliance is to **score more than your opponents.**

This requires you to know your robot and its capabilities well. 
Namely things like:
* How good are your autos?
 * Which auto roles is your robot good at? Unreliable at? Good enough at?
* How good is your teleop (overall, in different specializations e.g. spec vs. samp)
 * If you aren't playing your primary role (e.g. doing spec as a samp bot), how good are you still?
* How good is your endgame?
 * If you skip endgame, do you score more overall without it?

### Single-role specialization

If you're only set up to do one particular role (e.g. spec OR sample), then you're probably picking for the other team's lane.
Also consider that having your robot do one particular role in auto and then switching for teleop may still be a valid strategy, although
in certain games (e.g. Freight Frenzy), the time overhead of doing so may lose you a crucial early lead.

### Double-role considerations

If your robot can do either roles (e.g. close/far crater, shared/alliance hub, spec/sample), you're probably looking for a team that matches the role you're better at.

**There is, however, one major exception to this that teams miss.**

Let's say that your robot can score 11 samples in high bucket (88 points) or 8 specimens on the chamber (80 points).
You probably feel that you're way better at doing sample than specimens.
It may be tempting to pick that team that can do 10 specimens on the chamber (100 points) and call it a day. 

However, if there is some robot that is _way_ better than you at sample (let's say they get 16 samples/128 points in high bucket), then you should pick that team and play specimen instead,
because 128 points in high bucket + 80 points in specimens > 88 points in high bucket + 100 points in specimens.

That's a **20 point difference (208 pts vs. 188 pts)** right there!

You also want to check on reliability and scoring capability of factors like **autonomous** and **endgame**. 
In ITD, not a lot of teams can do L3 hangs, but if they can manage 8 bucket cycles and an L3 hang, it's like they get a free 2 cycles.
Likewise, if you have a team that does 10 cycles but can't hang, that's still a negative 2 cycle difference.

### Desperation considerations

If you are hopelessly outmatched and you think you're probably going to end up in a 1v2, then you **probably need a defense bot.**
Finding teams that know how to play defense is really hard these days, but your general strategic goals are to:

1. try and match (or get an advantage) in auto + endgame as much as you can 
2. have the defense player shut down approximately 1 bot's worth of teleop output.
3. avoid penalties, perhaps at the cost of minor scoring opportunities (e.g. don't try and score on shared hub to get penalties, _only_ block off the OP shared bot to make it a 1v1)

Good luck if you are in this scenario.

## Finding viable teams to be with

The gold standard for this is full match scouting with some sort of analysis spreadsheet, but very few FTC teams have the resources to actually pull this off, not to mention pulling it off well.
Fortunately, we have technology that can do like 90% of the work for you now. 

1. Go to https://ftcscout.org
2. Pull up your event
3. Sort by **"np OPR"** to get a sense of who scores good.
   This can also serve as a useful metric to determine when you should let another team do the task you're good at for you, teams that seem to have auto + endgame down, and stuff like that.
4. Once you have a general sense, click on the **"Insights"** tab
5. Sort all the matches by the primary metrics you care to pick for (e.g. **"DC Sample"**).
   Click on the teams in the matches to highlight them and note teams that appear frequently high on the list.
7. If a team has some outlier matches (good or bad), note how early or late in the match schedule they are.
   **Robots tend to get better later in the match schedule** and if a robot was broken but now works that team may be a sleeper pick.
   This is why teams that only pick based on cumulative averages tend to get obliterated in elims by teams that suddenly start working way better.
8. Once you have some notable teams, eyeball their **auto and endgame category scores** to see how reliable and/or outstanding those are. 
   Consistent autos become a must the later in the season you get and being able to perform extra endgame tasks (e.g. L3 climb) can offset or even augment lower teleop cycle counts but are easy to overlook.
9. Make a **"team priority list"** ordered by who you would like to be with the most in elims.

FTC teams don't play a ton of matches so you really do need to do a lot of eyeballing and preferably talking to the teams and examining their robots themselves.
But you can get very far just by fiddling around with FTCScout even if you have zero match scouting.


## Picking teams as an alliance captain
If you find yourself as an alliance captain who is now being asked to pick a team, **always pick in order of best team to play with that can still be picked even if you think they will decline.**

Your alliance representative should always at least _know_ vaguely who to pick if you're suddenly called in as 5th or 6th captain.

If a team is telling you they are broken and not to pick them?
They might be lying so they can be picked by a later alliance. Use your judgement if you want to still pick them anyway.

If a team says they're going to decline for advancement reasons? **Try to pick them anyway so they can't defect on that promise.**
It may seem awkward to do, but the worst thing they can do is say no.

**Do not take it personally if a team declines you!** That's just how these things go. 
Look at it this way; if all the other captains decline you, they can't pick each other (the "scorched earth" strategy), which should hopefully put you in a much stronger spot for elims when you picked that one really good team that isn't a captain.

## Getting picked as an alliance captain

If you are going to be a captain, your alliance representative should probably know which teams they are going to accept invitations from and which they are going to decline.
The basic question you want to ask for each higher ranked captain is **"Can I get to finals by accepting them, or will I have a better shot with the remaining pool of pickable teams if I decline?"**

Ask yourself, **"What happens if these captains make optimal picks, and what happens if they don't?"** and hash out what teams are left for you to ally with in either scenario. 

Another captain's compatibility with your team is complicated (and discussed earlier) but **you should at least look at their OPR as a ballpark metric;** you probably _shouldn't_ be accepting that captain with an OPR of 7 for example
because that alliance is going to be worse than if you had declined and picked a team that can at least hang.


## Getting picked in general

Alliance captain or not, however, you should **always shill to the teams ranked above you that you want to be picked by.**
These can be teams all the way down to rank 6 or 7 in 4-alliance brackets or ranks 10 or 11 in 6-alliance brackets.
This is an imperfect science but can help prevent suboptimal picks or getting unpicked entirely.

Unlike in the old 4-alliance format, you want to talk to **several different captains** ideally, because half of them might get picked by a higher captain and you can't just rely on 1st seed 2nd picking you if you don't get picked early.

If you anticipate a captain that you want to be picked by getting potentially picked by a higher captain, consider **making the case for why they should decline and try picking you instead.**

If a team you do not want to be picked by approaches you, consider **making the case why another team may be a better fit for them.**
Avoid lying in this scenario (and sometimes just being honest about your intentions at like, Champs where advancement isn't on the line may make them leave you alone).

At the qualifier and leagues level especially, a lot of viable captains go into elims not really knowing how to pick, so **approaching them to actively guide the process** can get you a lot of leverage.
